We focus on the use of multi-source satellite imagery to assess land-atmosphere interactions. Our research aims at developing innovative remote sensing methods for quantifying the effect of climate (change) on snow/ice, vegetation dynamics, etc. and determine their (climate) feedbacks. We work on big data solutions to bridge the gap between remote sensing technology and its (scientific) applications.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Research topics</h2>
										<p>Understanding land-atmosphere interactions is crucial if we want to assess and model the effect of climate (change) on ecosystem dynamics, the hydrological cycle, sea level rise, etc. and quantify their feedbacks on climate. Satellite remote sensing plays an important role in understanding these land-atmosphere interactions. Firstly, because it allows to quantify spatio-temporal variations in land-surface processes (e.g. changes in snow/ice properties, vegetation dynamics) and link them to climate (anomalies). This is essential at extensive scales or in locations where in-situ data is sparse. Secondly, because satellite remote sensing provides an essential tool to evaluate and improve land-atmosphere models, which often still have large uncertainties related to land-surface processes and land-atmosphere feedbacks.</p>
										<p>EarthMapps focuses on the opportunities at the intersection of remote sensing and land-surface models. More specifically it concentrates on the use of multi-source remote sensing to improve our understanding of atmosphere-snow/ice and atmosphere-vegetation interactions in order to improve their representation in land-atmosphere models. This is particularly important as the uncertainties in these interactions have a large effect on our projections of future climate, hydrological cycle, sea level rise, vegetation dynamics. For example, the current understanding of the future state of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and Antarctica and their contribution to sea level rise is still partly hampered by the understanding of the (sub-)surface processes and their representation in land-atmosphere models; or the projection of future vegetation dynamics and their climate feedbacks is still strongly determined by the limited understanding of vegetation response to climate anomalies.</p>

										<p>Technologically we work on the interface between multi-source satellite imagery, radiative transfer models, land-surface models (e.g. snowmodels) and climate models. Within this framework we aim at developing and integrating innovative methodologies to assess the Earth's surface properties, mainly snow/ice and vegetation related, and understand their complex spatio-temporal response to climate. These methodologies range from improved data processing and data assimilation/merging, to big data solutions and time series analysis (e.g. tipping points). </p>
										<p>We exploit a broad collection of remote data sets that often bridge the gap between land remote sensing and atmospheric remote sensing. For example, in the past we have worked with multi-spectral optical satellite imagery (e.g. MODIS, Sentinel-2, Landsat, Proba-V, etc.), SAR backscatter data (e.g., Sentinel-1), microwave radiometer data (e.g. AMSR-E), scatterometer backscatter data (e.g. Quikscat, Ascat) atmospheric remote sensing data (e.g. Cloudsat, Calipso, Ceres) etc. to improve our understanding the interaction between atmosphere and land surface processes.</p>

																			<h3 class="major">Meltwater lakes in East Antarctic</h3>
																			<p>Ice shelves are the gatekeepers of Antarctica: they control how much ice flows off the ice sheet and melts into the ocean. Surface melt and subsequent firn air depletion can ultimately lead to disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves causing grounded glaciers to accelerate and sea level to rise. In this study we provide observational and model evidence that this process also occurs over an East Antarctic ice shelf, where meltwater induced firn air depletion is found in the grounding zone. In East Antarctica this meltwater is the result of a regional micro-climate as a result of wind-albedo interaction.</p>

																			<h3 class="major">Clouds enhance Greenland ice sheet meltwater runoff</h3>
																			<p>The Greenland ice sheet has become one of the main contributors to global sea level rise, predominantly through increased meltwater runoff. The main drivers of Greenland ice sheet runoff, however, remain poorly understood. Here we use a unique combination of active satellite observations, climate model data and snow model simulations to asses the role of Greenland cloud on meltwater runoff. Our results show that clouds enhance meltwater runoff by about one-third relative to clear skies. The sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to clouds highlights the need for accurate cloud representations in climate models, to better predict future contributions of the Greenland ice
								sheet to global sea level rise.</p>

																			<h3 class="major">Tipping points for <br/>
																				the Greenland ice caps</h3>
																			<p>Melting of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GICs) contributes about 43% to contemporary sea level rise. While patterns of GrIS mass loss are relatively well studied, the spatial and temporal evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear. Here we use a novel, high-resolution (1 km) surface mass balance product, evaluated against in-situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 as a tipping point for the mass balance of Greenland’s GICs. That year marks the
								onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn layer to refreeze meltwater.</p>

																			<p>Weather extremes have harmful impacts on communities around Lake Victoria, where thousands of fishermen die every year because of intense night-time thunderstorms. Yet how these thunderstorms will evolve in a future warmer climate is still unknown. Here we show that Lake Victoria is projected to be a hotspot of future extreme precipitation intensification by using new satellite-based observations, a high-resolution climate projection for the African Great Lakes and coarser-scale ensemble projections. Our results highlight a major hazard associated with climate change over East Africa and underline the need for high-resolution projections to assess local climate change</p>

																			<h3 class="major">Vegetation response to climate anomalies</h3>
																			<p>In order to mitigate the ecological, economical and social consequences of
								future climate change, we must understand and quantify the response of vegetation to short-term climate anomalies. In this study we developed a statistical model of vegetation resilience and resistance to drought and temperature anomalies. Our model is the first to simultaneously derive vegetation resistance and resilience metrics at a global scale, explicitly taking into account the spatial variability of short-term climate anomalies and data reliability. Its results highlight the impact of tree cover, non-tree vegetation and bare soil on vegetation resilience.</p>
